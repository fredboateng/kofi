<h2>Starts at Intranet development systems lecture</h2>
<p>After so many years of studies <a href="#">Fred</a> has just started learning how to build a web site at
    the prestigeous <a href="http://www.rgu.ac.uk/">Robert Gordon University</a>. This is
    indeed the doing of the Lord. My brilliance left me stranded and confused. Like in the begining when the earth
    with all its resources was without form and void because God had cast down satan here and left it alone so is a
    a man's life without God. He may be resourced physically interlectually morally and many God but One thing I have
    come know is that without God it One life is still without form and void. Solomon puts it best by say "End of the
    matter is this fear God and keep his commandments"
